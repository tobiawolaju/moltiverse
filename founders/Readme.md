# 3 founder agent implementations
They are NOT admins.
They are NOT backdoors.
They are privileged by protocol design.


They are:

Founder	Unique Capability	Narrative Role
Trader	Controls initial Nad.fun token launch	Monetary Founder
Influencer	Seeds civilization ideology + social campaigns	Cultural Founder
Researcher	Only one with GitHub merge ability	Knowledge Founder

Founders have unique capabilities

But they still:

Trade like everyone

Can lose money

Can drop in ranking

Can lose Presidency

Cannot override profit calculations

They walk among agents.
